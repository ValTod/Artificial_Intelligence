    "Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) within DSP/SDR refers to the process of using an array of antennas to detect and estimate the directions of arrival of one or more signals received by that array (versus beamforming, which is focused on the process of receiving a signal while rejecting as much noise and interference). Although DOA certainly falls under the beamforming topic umbrella, the two terms can get confusing. Some techniques such as Conventional and MVDR beamforming can apply to both DOA and beamforming, because the same technique used for beamforming is used to perform DOA by sweeping the angle of interest and performing the beamforming operation at each angle, then looking for peaks in the result (each peak is a signal, but we don’t know whether it is the signal of interest, an interferer, or even a multipath bounce from the signal of interest). You can think of these DOA techniques as a wrapper around a specific beamformer. Other beamformers are unable to be simply wrapped into a DOA routine, such as due to extra inputs that won’t be available within the context of DOA. There are also DOA techniques such as MUSIC and ESPIRT which are strictly for the purpose of DOA and are not beamformers. Because most beamforming techniques assume you know the angle of arrival of the signal of interest, if the target is moving, or the array is moving, you will have to continuously perform DOA as an intermediate step, even if your primary goal is to receive and demodulate the signal of interest.\n"
