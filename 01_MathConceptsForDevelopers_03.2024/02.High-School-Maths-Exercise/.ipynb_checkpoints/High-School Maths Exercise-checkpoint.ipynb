    "### Problem 1. Markdown\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is a very light, beautiful and convenient way to organize your research and display your results. Let's play with it for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can double-click each cell and edit its content. If you want to run a cell (that is, execute the code inside it), use Cell > Run Cells in the top menu or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, each cell has a type. There are two main types: Markdown (which is for any kind of free text, explanations, formulas, results... you get the idea), and code (which is, well... for code :D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you a...\n",
    "#### Quick Introduction to Markdown\n",
    "##### Text and Paragraphs\n",
    "There are several things that you can do. As you already saw, you can write paragraph text just by typing it. In order to create a new paragraph, just leave a blank line. See how this works below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is some text.\n",
    "This text is on a new line, but it will continue the same paragraph (so you can make your paragraphs more easily readable by just continuing on a new line, or just go on and on like this one line is ever continuing).\n",
    "\n",
    "This text is displayed in a new paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is yet another paragraph.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is some text.\n",
    "This text is on a new line, but it will continue the same paragraph (so you can make your paragraphs more easily readable by just continuing on a new line, or just go on and on like this one line is ever continuing).\n",

    "And this is yet another paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headings\n",
    "There are six levels of headings. Level one is the highest (largest and most important), and level 6 is the smallest. You can create headings of several types by prefixing the header line with one to six \"#\" symbols (this is called a pound sign if you are ancient, or a sharp sign if you're a musician... or a hashtag if you're too young :D). Have a look:\n",

    "##### Heading 5\n",
    "###### Heading 6\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you have **only one** H1 heading - this should be the header of your notebook (or scientific paper). Below that, you can add your name or just jump to the explanations directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Emphasis\n",
    "You can create emphasized (stronger) text by using a **bold** or _italic_ font. You can do this in several ways (using asterisks (\\*) or underscores (\\_)). In order to \"escape\" a symbol, prefix it with a backslash (\\). You can also strike through your text in order to signify a correction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**bold** __bold__\n",
    "*italic* _italic_\n",

    "I ~~didn't make~~ a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lists\n",
    "You can add two types of lists: ordered and unordered. Lists can also be nested inside one another. To do this, press <kbd>Tab</kbd> once (it will be converted to 4 spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an ordered list, just type the numbers. Don't worry if your numbers are wrong - Jupyter Notebook will create them properly for you. Well, it's better to have them properly numbered anyway...\n",

    "        \n",
    "##### Links\n",
    "There are many ways to create links but we mostly use one of them: we present links with some explanatory text. See how it works:\n",

    "# Breed Of Cats\n",
    "## Autor: Valerie Todorov\n",
    "### Abstract:\n",
    "This is a short information about some cat breeds, colected from internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Maine Coon\n",
    "The Maine Coon is a large domesticated cat breed. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America.\n",
    "The breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine, where it is the official state cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Maine Coon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Maine_Coon_cat_by_Tomitheos.JPG) *__Maine Coon__*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. History\n",
    "The __Maine Coon__ is one of the largest domesticated cats. It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills.\n",
    "The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century.\n",
    "The Maine Coon has since made a comeback, in 2020 becoming the third most popular pedigree cat breed in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1. Origin\n",
    "Maine Coon cats originated in Maine. However, their lineage is surrounded by mystery, folk tales, and myths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2. Myths\n",
    "One myth claims the Maine Coon cat is a hybrid with another animal species, such as the raccoon or bobcat.\n",
    "The second myth states the cats are descendants of Viking ship's cats, known today as the Norwegian Forest cats. \n",
    "A third story involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France with the help of Captain Samuel Clough. \n",
    "She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora or possibly Siberian cats. \n",
    "Although she did not make it to the United States, all of her pets managed to reach the shore of Wiscasset, Maine, safely, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.3. Science\n",
    "These myths and theories have long speculated that the long-haired Maine Coon cat has to be related to other long-haired breeds, due to their similarities in phenotype. \n",
    "And for the Maine Coon in particular, that it is descended from the Norwegian or Siberian Forest cat, brought to New England by settlers or Vikings. However, phylogenetic studies showed that the Maine Coon belongs to the Western European monophyletic cat branch, but forms the closest relationship with the random-bred cat population in the Northeastern US (New York region). \n",
    "This Western European branch also contains the Norwegian and Siberian Forest cat, but they fall under a different sub-branch. \n",
    "The Maine Coons are descendants of cats brought to New England by Puritan settlers in the 1600-1700s, and out of the European cats they are genetically closest to cats found in the United Kingdom. \n",
    "It is not relatedness that makes them look similar to the Norwegian and Siberian Forest cats, but convergent evolution. These breeds all formed in harsh climates in which natural selection pressures for similar qualities. \n",
    "Thick, long coats, toe and ear tufts, big bodies, and snowshoe-like big feet, are useful traits in all the harsh climates where these breeds originate from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1. Fur coat\n",
    "The __Maine Coon__ is a long or medium-haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, although texture may vary with coat color.\n",
    "The length is shorter on the head and shoulders and longer on the stomach and flanks, with some cats having a leonine ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed compared to other long-haired breeds, as their double coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat.\n",
    "The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2. Coat colors\n",
    "_Maine Coons_ can have any colors that other cats have. Colors indicating crossbreeding, such as chocolate, lavender, the Siamese pointed patterns or the \\\"ticked\\\" patterns, are not accepted by some breed standards. This is not universal; the ticked pattern, for example, is accepted by TICA and CFA.\n",
    "The most common pattern seen in the breed is brown tabby. All eye colors are accepted under breed standards, with the exception of blue or odd-eyes, i.e. heterochromia iridium (two eyes of different colors), in cats possessing coat colors other than white.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.3. Size\n",
    "11-month-old cream tabby male kitten being held at cat sh.ow\n",
    "The Maine Coon was considered the largest breed of domestic cat until the introduction of the Savannah cat in the mid 1980s, and is still the largest non-hybrid cat.\n",
    "On average, males weigh from 18 to 22 lb (8.2 to 10.0 kg), with females weighing from 12 to 15 lb (5.4 to 6.8).\n",
    "The height of adults can vary between 10 and 16 in (25 and 41 cm) and they can reach a length of up to 38 in (97 cm), including the tail, which can reach a length of 14 in 36 and is long, tapering, and heavily furred, almost resembling a raccoon's ta. \n",
    "The body is solid and muscular, which is necessary for supporting their weight, and the chest is bod. \n",
    "Maine Coons possess a rectangular body shape and are slow to physically mature; their full size is normally not reached until they are three to five years old, while other cats take about one year   \n",
    "    \n",
    "## 2. Bengal cat\n",
    "The Bengal cat is a breed of hybrid cat created from crossing of an Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), with domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau. \n",
    "It is then usually bred with a breed that demonstrates a friendlier personality, because after breeding a domesticated cat with a wildcat, its friendly personality may not manifest in the kitten. \n",
    "The breed's name derives from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.\n",
    "Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes from their leopard cat ancestry, and their coats may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling. \n",
    "They are an energetic breed that needs much exercise and play\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2.1. History\n",
    "#### 2.1.1. Early history\n",
    "The earliest mention of an Asian leopard cat × domestic cross was in 1889, when Harrison Weir wrote of them in Our Cats and All About Them.\n",
    "#### 2.1.2. Bengals as a breedy    \n",
    "Jean Mill of California is given credit for the modern Bengal breed. She made the first known deliberate cross of an Asian leopard cat with a domestic cat (a black California tomcat). Bengals as a breed did not really begin in earnest until much later.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.2.1. Cat registries\n",
    "In 1986, the breed was accepted as a \\\"new breed\\\" by The International Cat Association; Bengals gained TICA championship status in 1991. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) accepted Bengal cats in 1997. Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) in 1999 accepted the breed into their registry.[6] Also in 1999, Bengals were accepted into the Australian Cat Federation (ACF). The Cat Fanciers' Association accepted the Bengal in CFA's \\\"Miscellaneous\\\" in 2016, under the restrictions that \\\"it must be F6 or later (6 generations removed from the Asian leopard cat or non-Bengal domestic cat ancestors).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.2.2. Early generations\n",
    "Bengal cats from the first three generations of breeding (F1, G2, and G3) are considered \\\"foundation\\\" or \\\"early-generation\\\" Bengals.\n",
    "The early-generation males are frequently infertile. Therefore, female early-generation Bengals are bred to fertile domestic Bengal males of later generations.\n",
    "Nevertheless, as the term was used incorrectly for many years, many people and breeders still refer to the cats as F2, F3, and F4, even though the term is considered incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.1.2.3. Popularity\n",
    "The Bengal breed was more fully developed by the 1980s. \\\"In 1992 The International Cat Association had 125 registered Bengal Breeders. \n",
    "By the 2000s, Bengals had become a very popular breed. In 2019, there were nearly 2,500 Bengal breeders registered in TICA worldwide.\n",
    "        \n",
    "### 2.2. Appearance\n",
    "#### 2.2.1. Markings\n",
    "##### 2.2.1.1. Colors\n",
    "    \n",
    "Bengals come in a variety of coat colors  The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes several Bengal colors: brown spotted, seal lynx point (snow), sepia, silver, and mink spotted tabby.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.2.1.2. Spotted rosetted\n",
    "The Bengal cat is the only domestic breed of cat that has rosette markings. People most often associate the Bengal with the most popular color: the brown spotted/rosetted Bengal. Nonetheless, Bengals have a wide variety of markings and colors. Even within the Brown spotted/rosetted category a Bengal can be: red, brown, black, ticked, grey, spotted, rosetted, clouded. Many people are stunned by the Bengal Cat's resemblance to a leopard. Among domestic cats, the Bengal markings are perhaps the most varied and unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1.3. Marble\n",
    "Domestic cats have four distinct and heritable coat patterns – ticked, mackerel, blotched, and spotted – these are collectively referred to as tabby markings.\n",
    "Christopher Kaelin, a Stanford University geneticist, has conducted research that has been used to identify the spotted gene and the marble gene in domestic Bengal cats.\n",
    "Kaelin studied the color and pattern variations of feral cats in Northern California, and was able to identify the gene responsible for the marble pattern in Bengal cats.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### 2.2.1.3. Legal restrictions\n",
    "- In Australia, G5 (fifth-generation) Bengals are not restricted, but their import is complex\n",
    "- Bengals were regulated in the United Kingdom. In 2007, however, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs removed the previous licensing requiremen\n",
    "* In the United States, legal restrictions and even bans sometimes exist at the state and municipal level. \n",
    "    - In Hawaii, Bengal cats are prohibited by law (as are all wild cat species, and all other hybrids of domestic and wild animals. \n",
    "    - In Connecticut, it is also illegal to own any generation of Bengal cat.\n",
    "    - In Alaska, Bengal cats must be four generations removed from the Asian leopard cat. A permit and registered pedigree that indicates the previous four generations are required.\n",
    "    - In California, the code of regulations Title 14, section K, Asian leopards are not specifically listed as a restricted species. \n",
    "    - In Delaware, a permit is required to own Bengal cats.\n",
    "    - Bengals of the F1-G4 generations are also regulated in New York state, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Indana. - Various cities have imposed restrictions; in New York City, Bengals are prohib][25] and there are limits on Bengal ownership in Seattle, Washington, and in Denver, Colorado.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except where noted above, Bengal cats with a generation of G5 and beyond are considered domestic, and are generally legal in the US.\n",

    "### Problem 2. Formulas and LaTeX\n",
    "Writing math formulas has always been hard. But scientists don't like difficulties and prefer standards. So, thanks to Donald Knuth (a very popular computer scientist, who also invented a lot of algorithms), we have a nice typesetting system, called LaTeX (pronounced _lah_-tek). We'll be using it mostly for math formulas, but it has a lot of other things to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to write formulas. You could enclose them in single `$` signs like this: `$ ax + b $`, which will create an **inline formula**: $ ax + b $. You can also enclose them in double `$` signs `$$ ax + b $$` to produce $$ ax + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commands start with a backslash and accept parameters either in square brackets `[]` or in curly braces `{}`. For example, to make a fraction, you typically would write `$$ \\frac{a}{b} $$`: $$ \\frac{a}{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here's a resource](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/freetex/latex%20basics.pdf) where you can look up the basics of the math syntax. You can also search StackOverflow - there are all sorts of solutions there.\n",

    "### Problem 9. Trigonometric Functions\n",
    "We already saw the graph of the function $y = \\sin(x)$. But then again, how do we define the trigonometric functions? Let's quickly review that.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Right triangle](angle-in-right-triangle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two basic trigonometric functions are defined as the ratio of two sides:\n",
    "$$ \\sin(x) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n",
    "$$ \\cos(x) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And also:\n",
    "$$ \\tan(x) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)} $$\n",
    "$$ \\cot(x) = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{opposite}} = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine, but using this, \"right-triangle\" definition, we're able to calculate the trigonometric functions of angles up to $90^\\circ$. But we can do better. Let's now imagine a circle centered at the origin of the coordinate system, with radius $r = 1$. This is called a \"unit circle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Trigonometric unit circle](triangle-unit-circle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now see exactly the same picture. The $x$-coordinate of the point in the circle corresponds to $\\cos(\\alpha)$ and the $y$-coordinate - to $\\sin(\\alpha)$. What did we get? We're now able to define the trigonometric functions for all degrees up to $360^\\circ$. After that, the same values repeat: these functions are **periodic**: \n",
    "$$ \\sin(k.360^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\sin(\\alpha), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "$$ \\cos(k.360^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, of course, use this picture to derive other identities, such as:\n",
    "$$ \\sin(90^\\circ + \\alpha) = \\cos(\\alpha) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important property of the sine and cosine is that they accept values in the range $(-\\infty; \\infty)$ and produce values in the range $[-1; 1]$. The two other functions take values in the range $(-\\infty; \\infty)$ **except when their denominators are zero** and produce values in the same range. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Radians\n",
    "A degree is a geometric object, $1/360$th of a full circle. This is quite inconvenient when we work with angles. There is another, natural and intrinsic measure of angles. It's called the **radian** and can be written as $\\text{rad}$ or without any designation, so $\\sin(2)$ means \"sine of two radians\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![Radian definition](radian.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's defined as *the central angle of an arc with length equal to the circle's radius* and $1\\text{rad} \\approx 57.296^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the circle circumference is $C = 2\\pi r$, therefore we can fit exactly $2\\pi$ arcs with length $r$ in $C$. The angle corresponding to this is $360^\\circ$ or $2\\pi\\ \\text{rad}$. Also, $\\pi \\text{rad} = 180^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Some people prefer using $\\tau = 2\\pi$ to avoid confusion with always multiplying by 2 or 0.5 but we'll use the standard notation here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** All trigonometric functions in `math` and `numpy` accept radians as arguments. In order to convert between radians and degrees, you can use the relations $\\text{[deg]} = 180/\\pi.\\text{[rad]}, \\text{[rad]} =  \\pi/180.\\text{[deg]}$. This can be done using `np.deg2rad()` and `np.rad2deg()` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse trigonometric functions\n",
    "All trigonometric functions have their inverses. If you plug in, say $\\pi/4$ in the $\\sin(x)$ function, you get $\\sqrt{2}/2$. The inverse functions (also called, arc-functions) take arguments in the interval $[-1; 1]$ and return the angle that they correspond to. Take arcsine for example:\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin(y) = x: sin(x) = y $$\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $$\n",

    "Please note that this is NOT entirely correct. From the relations we found:\n",
    "$$\\sin(x) = sin(2k\\pi + x), k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "it follows that $\\arcsin(x)$ has infinitely many values, separated by $2k\\pi$ radians each:\n",
    "$$ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} + 2k\\pi, k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, however, we're interested in the first value (when $k = 0$). It's called the **principal value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: There are inverse functions for all four basic trigonometric functions: $\\arcsin$, $\\arccos$, $\\arctan$, $\\text{arccot}$. These are sometimes written as $\\sin^{-1}(x)$, $\\cos^{-1}(x)$, etc. These definitions are completely equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
